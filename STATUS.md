# Status

- Packages `client` and `server` were removed to focus on the sturdy-ref library surface.
- Shared protocol definitions now live in `@a2a/types`.
- The CapnWeb transport package exposes sturdy-ref interfaces with in-memory and CapnWeb adapters, plus test shims.
- Tooling now relies on Biome for linting and Vitest for tests; project references updated.
