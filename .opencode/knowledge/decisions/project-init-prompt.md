Build out the project that consists of the library, and a client and server implementation in typescript to that:
- is using bun as the build and runtime of server application,
(either in an isolated env or global however is best for bun)
- the prject should have configuration for linters, binary build and run scripts, cleanup scripts , gitignore,
- and a minimal viable project that builds, extending the sdk libraries described below.

Server implementation we will extend: typescript acp sdk, and should follow the typescript acp server implementation
